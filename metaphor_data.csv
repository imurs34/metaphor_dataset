1) The black hole is like an object in the outer space continuum that moves faster than your brain thinks it moves in that continuum.
2) The white hole is like a point-to- point distance in an axial coherent spin model in that, compared to an infinite number, there is an order on which it cannot travel for any time.
3) The singularity is like an image on a digital imaging camera in that it stands alone on its surface and that there is nobody with it in view and it seems alone.
4) The event horizon is like the a axis of rotating coaxial coherent spin particles or vectors in our model in that the origin of this spin can occur at either the end or middle position of this event horizon at the center or the opposite sides of the spin vector from the center to an extreme end of this area.
5) The ergosphere is like some kind of an extra universe in the physical world in that all the planets and all our life forms exist in the e."
Advanced,XLNet,theory of the naked singularity,"theory of the naked singularity is like a web because of the connection and connections between the various theories in it.
-The black hole is like a spider- web of connections between particles made from a small quantity in that black hole- and its environment.
-The white hole is like some sort of gap between galaxies and a gap is like that thing between stars when a giant black hole is coming through in that other universe.
-The singularity is like a spider in that it exists and can reach out to us at all of the directions on it.
-The event horizon is like an extended graph of the web in that there are events, and there can occur several events once in an instant, which we know as waves or events.
-The accretion disk is like an infinity ring with holes around the periphery and a ring encompassing the hole in that circumstice."
Advanced,XLNet,theory of the naked singularity,"theory of the naked singularity is like writing an elegant metaphor to describe our own predicament because it describes a situation from a different perspective: we are in another universe entirely.
1) the black hole singularity is like the hole in the net because we are trapped in it for the first time – not because we know where it happens; we feel that in that moment and have a fear that nothing will be able to help us through it again; we think that something else will come and fill the opening, something different from the world around.
2) the white hole singularity is like a diagram that shows where a hole can open in that web to get in space away from our sun and to get into space towards the sun or toward us towards each other.
3) the spacetime singularity is like the description a metaphor for being caught up in it in that moment where everything seems real and it seems too hard to believe it.
4) the quantum singularity is like an exquisite metaphor that describes our dilemma and so we should describe an ideal metaphor to describe it in that way as described by the Einstein model of particle dynamics in section III of the I-E series of paper and in (c) section (II of) the I-G series of paper; that is (d:)."
Advanced,XLNet,theory of the naked singularity,"theory of the naked singularity is like building a web and putting everything we know together because everything we see we must know together.
1. The nature of the singularity is like The nature of the singularity in that case was: the energy density disappeared as a single black hole (A hole) in the middle (A).
2. The formation of the singularity is like The formation of the singularity in that image, is like formation of an optical defect with respect to the normal optic field within a small sphere.
3. The effects of the singularity is like The effects of the singularity in that it changes everything that has been written and will be written about quantum mechanics as of the end to the theory.
4. The stability of the singularity is like The stability of the singularity in that theory is like the instability in the theories to come."
Advanced,XLNet,theory of the naked singularity,"theory of the naked singularity is like a single piece in the larger puzzle – it shows the whole world in its true perspective because every single singularity can look at its surroundings and notice how far it looks in relation in terms of the overall scale.
1) The black hole singularity is like an ion beam through thin air in that the black hole has a very tiny radius that surround it.
2) The white hole singularity is like a single piece in larger puzzle; this time though it has the capacity to change it forever in that same way.
3) The Kerr singularity is like being exposed to bright sun beam and being completely blind for one week at a in that area of space where there is no visible radiance in that direction.
4) The Reissner-Nordstrom singularity is like a puzzle in that many people cannot solve that singularity even if they know where they are going because they have yet to see or hear anything beyond that point in order to understand how they are going or get out there and discover a source of new information that leads."
